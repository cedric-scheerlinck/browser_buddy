# AI Content Detector Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that detects and highlights AI-generated content on webpages.

## Current Features (Work in Progress)

- Basic popup interface to initiate content scanning

## Planned Features

- Send extracted text to Claude API to detect AI-generated content
- Highlight AI-generated sections on the webpage
- Settings to customize detection sensitivity

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your computer.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" by clicking the toggle switch in the top right corner.
4. Click the "Load unpacked" button.
5. Navigate to and select the directory containing this extension.

## How to Use

1. Click on the extension icon in your browser toolbar
2. Click the "Scan This Page" button
3. The extension will read all text on the current webpage
4. (Future feature) The extension will analyze the text and highlight AI-generated content

## Files

- `manifest.json`: Extension configuration and permissions
- `popup.html`: Main popup UI
- `popup.js`: JavaScript for popup functionality
- `popup.css`: Styling for the popup
- `contentScript.js`: Script that runs in the context of the webpage to extract text

## How It Works

### Step 1: Reading the DOM (Current Implementation)
The extension uses a content script to traverse the Document Object Model (DOM) of the webpage you're visiting. It extracts text from various HTML elements like paragraphs, headings, list items, etc. 

### Step 2: AI Detection (Future Implementation)
The extracted text will be sent to Claude AI to analyze and detect which sections were likely generated by AI.

### Step 3: Highlighting (Future Implementation)
The detected AI-generated sections will be highlighted on the webpage so you can easily see which parts were created by AI.

## Note about Icons

This extension references icon files in the `images` directory. For a complete extension, you should add icon files with the following names:
- `images/icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `images/icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `images/icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons or replace them with your own.
